# **Welcome!**

### In order to use our platform, first you have to create and run a local ![SYNAISTHISI][1] instance on your machine, via **Docker**.


Not to worry though! We have prepared a quick and easy guide on how to do it on your own:


>Before going into the guide, you should have **Docker** and **docker-compose** installed on your machine. If you haven't,  [*here's*][2] *Docker*'s official documentation page, where you'll find anything you might need.


## *The Guide:*
After installing **Docker** and **docker-compose** open a *Terminal*, and clone the repository. 
You will have to create a *.env* file, including values of critical environment variables. An example is given in *env_example.txt*. **We strongly recommend to change the default values**.


Then, run the following commands:

1.      cd synaisthisi-iot/docker_compose
2.      sudo docker-compose up



Interfaces and Ports:

80:   Platform portal and GUI

3000: HTTP/REST/MQTT-Websockets

1883: MQTT

5672: AMQP

5683/UDP: CoAP

8083: tomcat8 [(link)][7]

8080: oM2M [(link)][8] [(more info)][9]

15672: RabbitMQ

1880: NodeRED

### Architecture overview
![Architecture](https://github.com/xarakas/synaisthisi-iot/blob/a5968e9f8281209df442042ab1ccf870b0040028/Wiki-pages/Arch-Syn-ContFlat4.png)

#### When the process is completed, visit [localhost][3] from a local browser and you should be able to see the **SYNAISTHISI** Home page!

Also, check the following SYNAISTHISI user guide video:
[SYNAISTHISI User Guide][10]

 **For more advanced users:**

 To access any container through a terminal that executes on the virtualized environment:

>     sudo docker exec -ti <container_name> bash

 and... 

>     exit

 when you need to exit the virtualized environment.

 **Additional commands that could come in handy...**

 Stop any container from running:

>     sudo docker stop <container_name>

 Remove the container (**Warning!** If you want to also delete user accounts, topics, services, etc. you will need to delete the corresponding docker volumes.)

>     sudo docker rm <container_name>

...and that concludes the guide.

#### *Perfect! You can now start building your services using ![SYNAISTHISI][1] platform.*

## *MQTT Support*
You can use any client (e.g., [mosquitto][4], or [mqtt-cli][5], etc.).

## *CoAP Support*
You can use any client (e.g., [coap-cli][6], etc.). See also in folder examples/SimplePubSub/coap-cli :
>     node index.js put coap://<broker-ip>:5683/r/<your topic> -p <message>
>     node index.js get coap://<broker-ip>:5683/r/<your topic>
However, be sure to:

a. Set req.options\[2\].value of the message to be the username.

b. Set req.options\[3\].value of the message to be the password

## *HTTP/REST Support*
You can use any client or library.
However, be sure to include username and password in the headers.

E.g.: 

GET -> curl -H "username:\[your username\]" -H "password:\[your password\]" http://localhost:3000/resources/\[your_topic\]

PUT -> curl -X PUT -H "username:\[your username\]" -H "password:\[your password\]" -d '\[your message\]' http://localhost:3000/resources/\[your_topic\]
